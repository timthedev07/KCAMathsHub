# Legislation

In order to support the daily operation of the platform and the provision of services to students, we demand a set of standards that all users must always comply with.

This page outlines a few issues that may disrupt the platform, as well as the corresponding consequences.

For all types of violations of the rules, we will record them internally and selectively report those to authorities.

## Spam & Misuse Handling

Every question, answer, and moderation comment posted must serve the intended purpose and should not contain arbitrarily entered/generated content.

In addition, excessively and senselessly posting content in an attempt to damage the service/data will also be tracked and recorded.

To address this, we have implemented and deployed checks to be run in certain time intervals that scan all of the information and report any abuse.

## Offensive or Inappropriate Content

The following types of content are forbidden anywhere on the platform (i.e. textual, externally linked, graphical):

- misinformation/disinformation
- any form of violence
- crime
- advertisement
- profanity and hate speech
- racial and religious comments
- personal attack
- unrelated content
- disclosure of confidential and personal information
- scams
- malware
- nudity and sexual content

## Potential outcomes

Once your misbehavior is recorded, we may discuss the issue with teachers, and starting from there, there may be actions taken as punishments.

Any user who violates the rules a **second time** will be permanently banned from the platform - there will not be any further warnings.
