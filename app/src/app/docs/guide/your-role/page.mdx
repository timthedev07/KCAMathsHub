Please make sure that, if there is a certain level of demand and your participation is needed, you stay actively contributing. If, by the end of each month's performance review, you have not contributed, then we may consider dismissing you (however, you could apply once again when you are ready to be a bit more committed - just a bit more).

## Moderators

You are in charge of regulating and ensuring the quality of answers.

We ask you to be **honest and sensible** when writing moderation comments and deciding on approval.

As with answerers, we require some effort, although not too much is needed, considering you also have work to handle from your subjects.
