# The Credit System

The credit <Coin className="inline-block -mt-1 mr-1" width={18} height={18} /> system is used to reflect the performance and influence of a user on the platform, as well as to be spent.

## Spending credits

Credits can be used to _boost_ your questions; this is the process where your question becomes prioritized and most visible. Therefore having a higher chance of being answered earlier.

To do so, make sure you have enough credits - each boost costs **<Coin className="inline-block -mt-1" width={18} height={18} /> 50**.

A question can be boosted if and only if it is **not answered/resolved**.

## Earning credits

By inviting new students through the referral program, you can boost your credits:

| Number of users referred | Credit gain                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2                      | <div className="flex items-center gap-2"><Coin width={20} height={20} />30</div> |
| 3-5                      | <div className="flex items-center gap-2"><Coin width={20} height={20} />40</div> |
| 6+                       | <div className="flex items-center gap-2"><Coin width={20} height={20} />50</div> |

By answering questions:

By moderating questions, moderators receive <Coin className="inline-block -mt-1" width={18} height={18} /> 50 each time. However, moderators must not spam moderation for credit gains, otherwise, it will be a permanent ban.

Deleting a moderation will take the 50 credits back.
