# CAS

This section only applies to Y12 and Y13 students.

Contributing as answerers and/or moderators is a great opportunity to enrich your CAS portfolio!

If you haven't joined the team and are considering it, [click here](/docs/guide/your-role) and find the corresponding application form(s).

If you are planning to add this to your CAS portfolio, this is how we _recommend_ you to fill in the details of the experience.

| Field                  | Example                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Experience name**    | Answering on KCAMathsHub |
| CAS strand             | Service                  |
| Type of service action | Direct                   |
| Approaches             | School-based, (ongoing)  |
| Learning outcome       | Strength & Growth        |

By the end of each month, you will be able to obtain a performance review (a summary of your contributions each month), and this can then be used as evidence for your CAS experience.

In combination with the report, it is also important to keep records of screenshots when you create answers/moderations on the platform.

This has been confirmed with the CAS coordinator.
