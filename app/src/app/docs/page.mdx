# :confetti_ball: Welcome to KCAMathsHub! :confetti_ball:

KCAMathsHub is the in-school platform that enables students to ask questions and have the right people to answer them. Internally, there is a group of moderators that perform the quality control step to ensure that as many questions receive a satisfying answer as possible.

This is the official documentation and support center of KCAMathsHub, this component aims to clarify any doubts and establish all of the regulations required to sustain normal operations.

It is **strongly recommended** that you read carefully through the section on [legislation](/docs/guide/legislation) to avoid committing any disruptive mistakes and hence being subject to punishment.

If your goal of using this platform isn't just asking questions, we advise you to look into [this section](/docs/guide/your-role) to take your next step.

For those of you participating to enrich your CAS portfolio (namely Y12 and Y13 students), dive into [the CAS section](/docs/guide/CAS) for more information.

## How it works

No matter which year group you study in, you can always ask for help here. Chances are, you may sometimes feel embarrassed - but no problem, we got you covered! There is an option to post anonymously and not reveal your identity.

Our team of answerers will regularly watch out for new questions, and it is almost guaranteed that at least one will have a suitable solution for you as soon as possible.

If you find that an answer solves your problem, you can _accept_ it, which will in turn make the question _answered_. However, if by any chance, you successfully find a solution before anyone responds, please mark it as answered, and if you are feeling like it, demonstrate your solution, and this **will** help anybody who encounters the same issue!
